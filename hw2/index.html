			<source src="http://download.blender.org/peach/bigbuckbunny_movies/BigBuckBunny_320x180.mp4" />
			Your browser does not support embedded video, but you
			can still download <a href="http://download.blender.org/peach/bigbuckbunny_movies/BigBuckBunny_320x180.mp4">
			<cite>Big Buck Bunny</cite></a> here.
		</video>
		<figcaption><a href="http://www.bigbuckbunny.org/"><cite>
		Big Buck Bunny</cite></a> is an open-content cartoon from the
		<a href="http://www.blender.org/">Blender Foundation.</a>
		</figure>

		<p>Even though I don't really go for rich-media sorts of things
		(I like the idea of the web as a way to deliver
		semantically-marked-up running text much more than as a way to
		deliver cat pictures and cartoons), I like the way the
		&lt;video&gt; tag works in HTML5, because it serves as a good
		example of how a rich-media page can gracefully degrade to
		running text if necessary. The following code should render
		something useful and meaningful under practically any
		circumstance, from modern ten-ton web browsers to something like
		<a href="http://lynx.invisible-island.net/">lynx</a>:</p>

<pre><code>
&lt;video controls&gt;
	&lt;source src="BigBuckBunny_320x180.mp4" /&gt;
	&lt;a href="BigBuckBunny_320x180.mp4"&gt;Your browser does not support
	embedded video, but you can still download &lt;cite&gt;Big Buck Bunny
	&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt; here.
&lt;/video&gt;</code></pre>

		<p>At the absolute worst, it only needs an additional two or
		three (dozen) additional &lt;source&gt; elements to accomodate
		web browsers that support different video codecs. (This is
		almost identical to the code used for the video above.)</p>
	</section>

	<hr />

	<section>
		<p>Sometimes, exact formatting matters. Markup languages such as
		HTML very commonly use some sort of rule to "normalize"
		whitespace. In the source for this document, for example, there
		is extra whitespace for indentation, to make the structure of
		the document more obvious to humans reading the source. You
		don't see this in your browser, because all any amount of
		whitespace does is separate one word from another, according to
		the semantics of HTML. This is a very good thing in general,
		but there needs to be some way of escaping from constraints
		like this. If, for example, I want to show you a C function:</p>

<pre><code>
char *strcpy(char *dst, char *src)
{
	while (*src != '\0')
	{
		*(dst++) = *(src++);
	}
	return dst;
}</code></pre>

		<p>it is very important that all whitespace be preserved
		exactly, or some of the intended meaning will be lost. (This
		would be even more important for a language like Python, where
		the rules of HTML would actually break the code, not just make
		it harder to read!) I think <strong>&lt;pre&gt;</strong> is a
		very important tag for this reason: it is the escape route.</p>
	</section>

	<hr />

	<section>
		<p>Finally, I would like to talk about one anti-favorite tag
		(and a "class" of favorite tags):
		<strong style="color: #D00000">&lt;div&gt; </strong>. Far, far
		too many websites still seem to use &lt;div&gt; in preference to
		new HTML5 tags like <strong> &lt;article&gt;</strong> or 
		<strong>&lt;aside&gt;</strong> for general-purpose divisions on
		pages. This (reliably) communicates semantic information about
		the divisions to absolutely nobody and nothing except that one
		page's stylesheets, because they happen to know the class names
		it happens to use. The new semantic tags are, by contrast, very
		interesting to me, because they bring the concept of semantic
		markup, which can be rendered in any manner the viewer wishes, 
		not necessarily just the way the designer intends, much closer
		to reality.
		
		<p>Consider as an example Firefox's 
		<a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/firefox/reader-view/">
		Reader View</a> feature, which uses semantic tags (among other
		methods - it has to have something to fall back on) to dig the
		actual content out of a webpage for easier reading. I think it
		should be possible to go much farther than this does, of course,
		but it demonstrates some of the exciting possibilities of true
		semantic markup, in a world beyond &lt;div&gt;.</p>
