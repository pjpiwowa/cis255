	<h2 class="spancols">Helpful and Harmful CSS Features</h2>

	<section id="column-span">
		<p>This article is contained within an HTML
		&lt;article&gt; element, which has CSS styling applied to it to
		enable the three-column layout. This is what makes semantic 
		sense to me; after all, it's the article that is divided into
		columns, not some division inside it. This leads to a bit of a
		semantic problem, however: I want the article title above to
		span across all three columns, but it also belongs inside the
		article (it is, after all, the article's header). The 
		(apparently relatively new) <strong>column-span</strong> CSS
		property provides the solution, allowing any element to be
		specified as spanning across all columns. (Unfortunately Firefox
		does not support it yet.)</p>
	</section>

	<hr />

	<section id="outline">
		<p>Interestingly, CSS has two different kinds of border. The
		<strong>outline</strong> property (a shorthand property similar
		to <strong>border</strong>) creates an outline around its
		element, outside the border box. I'm not quite sure whether it's
		really genuinely helpful, but this page uses them in an attempt
		to make links "stand out" better.</p>
	</section>

	<hr />

	<section id="colrules">
		<p>I normally don't like multi-column layouts very much. I'm not
		sure whether it's a common reaction, but I simply find them
		harder to read; it seems to take a little extra mental
		processing to "follow" the columns. Fortunately, CSS has
		(something of) an answer: the <strong>column-rule</strong>
		family of properties (used on this page) allow lines of various
		types to be placed between the columns, making the separation
		much more visually clear.		
	</section>

	<hr />

	<section id="transitions" class="hoverfade">
		<p>CSS' <strong>transition</strong> support is somewhat
		interesting to me, in that it permits some very simple
		animations without relying on any client-side scripting, in a
		way that fits in with other CSS features such as the
		<strong>:hover</strong> pseudo-selector very well. As a result,
		it's extremely easy to make "glitzy" animations that are very
		likely to render correctly, even if the user (<a
		href="https://noscript.net/faq#qa1_10">wisely</a>) disables
		Javascript for untrusted, possibly-evil websites like this one.
		<strong>Hover over this section for a very silly demonstration
		of CSS transitions!</strong></p></p>

	<section id="downloadable-fonts">
		<p>While not strictly a property, the <strong>@font-face
		</strong> pseudo-selector allows <em>defining</em> a new value
		for the <strong>font-family</strong> property. Specifically, it
		allows the document author to specify that a new font be
		downloaded for use in rendering the page. This superficially
		sounds like a good idea; no more are designers constrained by
		whatever fonts the user happens to have available.</p>

		<figure class="float-right" id="sylvester"
		style="max-width: 128px;">

			<figcaption>
				Downloadable fonts help Sylvester get to the
				bird feeder. You don't want that, do you?
			</figcaption>
		</figure>

		<p>Unfortunately this overlooks a serious problem: font parsers
		are <em>extremely</em> complex, and were generally not
		originally designed with untrusted input in mind. This means
		that the introduction of this feature created a whole new class
		of security vulnerabilites, especially serious on Microsoft
		Windows systems where security flaws in the font parser have
		often resulted in arbitrary code execution
		<a href="https://threatpost.com/of-truetype-font-vulnerabilities-and-the-windows-kernel/101263/">
		<em>in the kernel</em></a>, because Windows parses fonts in
		kernel space for "performance" reasons. (The feature has also
		been blatantly misused; for instance, use of custom downloadable
		"fonts" to render icons has caused accessiblity issues and
